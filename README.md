## Overview

**dsrt.js** is a modern, lightweight, and secure 3D rendering engine designed as an evolution beyond traditional libraries.  
It focuses on performance, modularity, and safety, with built-in support for loaders, materials, lights, physics integration, and WebGPU-ready rendering.

---

## Features

- ðŸ“¦ Modular architecture (Engine â†’ Scene â†’ Renderer â†’ Loader)  
- ðŸŽ¨ Materials, lights, geometries, cameras, and animation system  
- ðŸ”’ Security-first (sandboxed shaders, safe loaders, dependency audits)  
- âš¡ WebGL2 + WebGPU experimental backend  
- ðŸ§ª Comprehensive testing with CI/CD integration  
- ðŸ“– Full documentation and examples  

---

## Installation

```bash
npm install dsrt.js

or via Yarn:

yarn add dsrt.js


---

Usage Example

import { Engine, Scene, PerspectiveCamera, BoxGeometry, Mesh, Renderer } from "dsrt.js";

const engine = new Engine();
const scene = new Scene();

const camera = new PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = 5;

const box = new Mesh(new BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1));
scene.add(box);

const renderer = new Renderer({ canvas: document.querySelector("#app") });
engine.run(() => {
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
});
